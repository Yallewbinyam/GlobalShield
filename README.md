# üõ°Ô∏è GlobalShield - Universal Cybersecurity Platform

## What is GlobalShield?

A cybersecurity app that automatically changes its interface to help different types of users:

- **Elderly people**: Simple buttons, clear language
- **Blind people**: Voice commands, screen reader support
- **People without internet**: Works offline
- **Small businesses**: Automated protection

## Why This Matters

- 1.3 billion disabled people can't use current security tools
- 771 million elderly people get confused by complex interfaces
- 2.6 billion people lack internet-based security
- 400 million small businesses can't afford enterprise security

## My Project Goals

1. Build working app with adaptive interfaces
2. Test with real users (elderly, disabled, etc.)
3. Prove it actually helps people stay safe online
4. Write academic paper about results

## What I'm Building

- Desktop app (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Mobile app (Android, iOS)
- Voice control features
- Offline security scanning
- Simple family alerts

## Timeline

- **Months 1-3**: Research and planning
- **Months 4-6**: Build core app
- **Months 7-9**: Add advanced features
- **Months 10-12**: Test and write report
